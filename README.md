## Overview

LoreSmith is a backend service that generates modular AI-driven lore pieces - characters, factions, settings, events, and relics, using asynchronous chains and OpenRouter API.

The system supports caching generated lore variants in Redis for improved performance and includes a mechanism to regenerate lore on demand, bypassing cache when needed.

## Features

- Modular AI-powered generation of lore pieces: characters, factions, settings, events and relics
- Supports multiple thematic styles (e.g., post-apocalyptic, fantasy) to tailor generated content
- Intelligent prompt chaining to produce coherent and rich lore narratives
- Caching generated lore results in Redis to improve response times and reduce redundant AI calls
- Option to regenerate lore on demand, bypassing cache when users want fresh content
- RESTful API with clear endpoints for each lore type and full lore bundles
- Easily extendable architecture to add new lore categories or themes
- Docker-ready for easy deployment and development with Redis integration

## Tech Stack & Tooling üõ†Ô∏è 

LoreSmith uses a modern Python backend stack optimized for asynchronous workflows and production readiness:

- **FastAPI** - High-performance web framework for building async APIs
- **SQLAlchemy** - Declarative, type-safe ORM for interacting with PostgreSQL
- **Alembic** - Schema migration tool for SQLAlchemy, used to version and manage database changes
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database for persistent lore and user data
- **Redis** - Used for caching AI-generated content and improving performance
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Containerized development environment with built-in Redis/PostgreSQL support

---

## AI Feature Roadmap

This roadmap outlines planned AI-powered features for LoreSmith, designed to progressively enhance lore generation, interactivity, and immersion.

### Phase 1: Core Extensions

- **Lore Extensions**  
  Generate short thematic story hooks or rumors based on existing lore pieces to add depth and flavor.
- **Basic NPC Chatbot**  
  Provide a chat endpoint seeded with individual character or faction data, enabling simple interactive dialogues.
- **Thematic Name Generator**  
  Generate character and place names guided by user-provided style or mood input for thematic consistency.

- **PostgreSQL Integration** ‚úÖ  
  Introducing persistent storage of AI-generated lore using PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy 2.x and asyncpg.  
  This enables saving user-selected content, tracking generations, and supporting future analytics.

  - Async support with SQLAlchemy 2.x (Declarative + `async_session`)
  - Store generated lore and user selections in a normalized schema
  - Designed for production with retry logic, error handling, and Docker-managed services

### Phase 2: Immersion & Localization

- **Procedural World Description Generator**  
  Automatically generate text-based world or region descriptions to enrich lore settings.
- **Multi-Language Support**  
  Add a `language` query parameter to output generated content in multiple languages, broadening accessibility.

### Phase 3: Advanced UX & Experimental

- **Enhanced NPC Dialogues with Memory**  
  Implement session state and conversation history for NPC chatbots to allow richer, context-aware interactions.
- **Lore Consistency Checker**  
  Analyze lore pieces to detect contradictions or inconsistencies, improving story coherence.
- **AI Visual Storytelling**  
  Integrate text-to-image AI to generate character portraits or concept art, enhancing visual immersion.

## Future Enhancements & Infrastructure Roadmap

To further enhance LoreSmith's scalability, resilience, and operational insights, the following integrations are planned:

* **Orchestration (Kubernetes):** Future deployment will leverage **Kubernetes** for container orchestration, enabling advanced scaling, self-healing, and efficient resource management
* **Observability Stack:** Integration of a comprehensive observability suite, including:
    * **Prometheus** for metrics collection and time-series data
    * **Grafana** for rich data visualization and dashboarding
    * **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing and enhanced insight into application performance

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Redis server running locally or accessible remotely
- OpenRouter API key set as environment variable

### Steps

1. Clone the repository and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdombrov-33/loresmith.git
cd loresmith
```

2. Create and activate Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Start your Redis server locally (or ensure remote Redis is accessible):

```bash
redis-server
```

5. Set ENV variables, example:

   - OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key
   - REDIS_HOST=localhost
   - REDIS_PORT=6379
   - REDIS_DB=0

6. Run the FastAPI application:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

7. Open [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) in your browser to explore and test the API.

## Using Docker Compose üê≥

This project uses Docker Compose to run the backend service alongside Redis.

To start the application:

- Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- This command will:
  - Build the backend Docker image from Dockerfile
  - Start a Redis container
  - Launch the FastAPI backend accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

To stop the containers:

- Use the command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## API Endpoints

The backend exposes RESTful endpoints for generating different lore pieces and full stories.

### Generate Multiple Lore Pieces

- **GET** `/api/generate/characters`

  Generate a list of character lore pieces.

  **Query parameters:**

  - `count` (int, optional): Number of items to generate. Default is 3. Range: 1-10.
  - `theme` (string, optional): Theme for generation. Default is `post_apocalyptic`.
  - `regenerate` (bool, optional): If `true`, bypass cache and generate fresh data.

- **GET** `/api/generate/factions`

  Similar to `/api/generate/characters` but for factions.
