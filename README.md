## ‚öôÔ∏è Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

LoreSmith uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD to ensure code quality, formatting consistency, and automated Docker deployment.

### ‚úÖ What's Automated

When you push to `main` branch:

1. **Code is linted** using `ruff`
2. **Code is formatted** (checked) using `black`
3. **Tests run** with `pytest`
4. **Docker image is built** and tagged as `vexenbay/loresmith-backend:latest`
5. **Docker image is pushed** to Docker Hub

All of the above steps run automatically via GitHub Actions on push or pull request.

### üîß Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit to auto-format Python files before commits using **black**.

To enable locally:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

You can run it manually with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### üê≥ Kubernetes Deployment (Manual)

Although the Docker image is automatically built and pushed, Kubernetes deployment remains manual for security and control reasons.

You can deploy locally with Minikube:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
kubectl rollout restart deployment/loresmith-backend
```

**Why Manual Deployment?**

The Kubernetes deployment step is intentionally kept manual and commented out in the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for several important reasons:

- **Local Environment Isolation**: GitHub runners don't have access to your local Minikube cluster, making automated K8s deployment impractical for local development setups
- **Security Considerations**: Automated cluster deployments require sensitive credentials and cluster access tokens that shouldn't be exposed in CI environments
- **Deployment Control**: Manual deployment allows for proper verification of changes, rollback capabilities, and staged deployments in production environments
- **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Different environments (dev, staging, prod) often require different configurations that are better handled through dedicated deployment processes

When you're ready to implement automated Kubernetes deployments, consider using dedicated tools like ArgoCD, Flux, or environment-specific deployment pipelines with proper security measures in place.

## üöÄ Kubernetes Deployment

LoreSmith runs on Kubernetes to leverage its inherent capabilities like container orchestration, self-healing, and resource management. The current deployment follows core Kubernetes patterns focused on reliability, with plans to add explicit resource allocation and autoscaling configurations.

### Architecture Overview

The Kubernetes setup leverages a microservices approach with the following core components:

- **Backend Deployment** - Manages the FastAPI application pods with automatic scaling and health monitoring
- **Service Layer** - Provides stable internal networking and load balancing across backend instances  
- **Ingress Controller** - Handles external traffic routing and SSL termination through NGINX
- **Configuration Management** - Uses ConfigMaps and Secrets for environment variables and sensitive data

### Key Components

#### Backend Deployment
- **Container Image**: `vexenbay/loresmith-backend:latest`
- **Environment Configuration**: Injected via Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps for secure credential management
- **Pod Management**: Automated lifecycle management, health checks, and rolling updates
- **Resource Allocation**: Resource allocation can be configured through CPU and memory requests/limits to optimize cluster usage.

#### Service & Networking
- **ClusterIP Service**: `loresmith-backend` exposes backend pods internally on port 80
- **Traffic Forwarding**: Routes external requests to container port 8000 seamlessly  
- **Internal DNS**: Kubernetes DNS resolution enables stable service-to-service communication
- **Database Connectivity**: Backend connects to Redis and PostgreSQL using their service DNS names (`redis`, `postgres`)

#### Ingress & External Access
- **NGINX Ingress Controller**: Manages HTTP/HTTPS traffic routing based on hostname rules
- **Local Development**: Hostname `loresmith.local` mapped to Minikube cluster IP via hosts file
- **Tunnel Access**: `minikube tunnel` creates network bridge for local development and testing
- **API Endpoints**: Full API accessible at `http://loresmith.local/docs`

### Local Development Setup
