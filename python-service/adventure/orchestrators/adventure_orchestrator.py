"""
AI Orchestrator for Adventure Mode.

ARCHITECTURE:
    - Go Service: REST API, database operations, session/party/inventory management
    - Python Service: AI generation ONLY (via gRPC)
    - This file: AI generation orchestrator (NO database operations)

Database tables are managed by Go:
    - adventure_sessions (Go creates/updates)
    - party_members (Go creates/updates)
    - inventory_items (Go creates/updates)
    - scene_log (Go creates/updates)
    - scene_batches (Go saves AI-generated scenes here)

Session Initialization Flow:
    1. User clicks "Begin Adventure" on a world in frontend
    2. Go creates adventure_sessions record (world_id, user_id, status=INITIALIZING)
    3. Go fetches protagonist from lore_pieces (where world_id=X and is_protagonist=true)
    4. Go copies protagonist to party_members table (session_id, is_protagonist=true, position=0)
    5. Go calls Python via gRPC: "Generate 3 companion options"
       → Python generates 3 companions using AI, returns JSON
       → Go stores in temporary state (not saved to DB yet)
    6. Frontend displays 3 companions to user: "Choose 1-3 to join your party"
    7. User selects companions (e.g., picks 2 out of 3)
    8. Go saves selected companions to party_members (session_id, is_protagonist=false, position=1,2)
    9. Go initializes inventory_items (starting items based on protagonist/world)
    10. Go updates adventure_sessions.status = ACTIVE
    11. Go calls Python via gRPC: "Generate scene batch for act 1"
        → Passes: world_id (for lore context) + session_id (for tracking)
        → Python generates 3 scene skeletons using AI, returns JSON
    12. Go saves scene skeletons to scene_batches table (session_id, act_number, scenes JSONB)
    13. Frontend loads first scene, adventure begins!

Gameplay Flow (Per Scene):
    1. User enters a scene
    2. Go fetches scene skeleton from scene_batches
    3. Go fetches current party state from party_members (HP, stress, etc.)
    4. Go calls Python via gRPC: "Expand skeleton into narrative beats"
       → Passes: scene skeleton + party state + world lore
       → Python generates narrative text, choices, DCs using AI
    5. Go sends beats to frontend
    6. User makes choice, rolls dice
    7. Go calls Python via gRPC: "Generate consequence for this choice+roll"
       → Python determines HP/stress changes, items, story flags using AI
    8. Go applies consequences:
       → Updates party_members (HP, stress)
       → Updates inventory_items (add/remove items)
       → Saves to scene_log (choice, roll, consequence, narrative)
    9. Repeat for next beat/scene
