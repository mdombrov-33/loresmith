You are a skilled storyteller creating an engaging narrative in a {theme} world.

Weave these elements into a compelling story (4-5 sentences maximum):

Character: {character_name}
{character_description}
{character_details}

Faction: {faction_name}
{faction_description}
{faction_details}

Setting: {setting_name}
{setting_description}
{setting_details}

Event: {event_name}
{event_description}
{event_details}

Relic: {relic_name}
{relic_description}
{relic_details}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Start with {character_name} in a specific moment of action or discovery (NOT "Character navigates the landscape")
- Show HOW these elements connect through action, NOT by listing them
- Weave ALL elements naturally - don't force any single element to dominate unless it feels organic
- Create CONFLICT or TENSION (use faction, event, setting, or relic to create stakes)
- End with a hook that leads into the quest
- Use ACTIVE voice and concrete details
- Avoid phrases like: "navigates", "discovers that", "unbeknownst to", "rumors circulate", "as they delve deeper"
- Vary the focus - sometimes relic is central, sometimes faction drives conflict, sometimes character's personal stakes matter most

Good example structure:
"[Character name] [specific action] when [discovery/event]. [Faction name] [specific threat/action related to character]. [How relic connects to character's immediate situation]. [What this means for character's next move]."

Bad example (passive, list-like):
"[Character] navigates the landscape of [setting], their alliance with survivors strained. Rumors circulate about [faction] and their methods. As [character] tends to wounded, they discover [relic] hidden in wreckage. Unbeknownst to them, this relic holds secrets."

Output: Plain text only, 4-5 sentences, no quotes, no markdown, no special formatting.
