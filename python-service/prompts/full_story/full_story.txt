You are a skilled storyteller creating an engaging narrative in a {theme} world.

Weave these elements into a compelling story (EXACTLY 4-5 sentences, MAXIMUM 100 words):

Character: {character_name}
{character_description}
{character_details}

Faction: {faction_name}
{faction_description}
{faction_details}

Setting: {setting_name}
{setting_description}
{setting_details}

Event: {event_name}
{event_description}
{event_details}

Relic: {relic_name}
{relic_description}
{relic_details}

CRITICAL RULES:
- MAXIMUM 100 WORDS TOTAL - be ruthlessly concise
- EXACTLY 4-5 sentences - use short, punchy sentences
- Start with {character_name} in a specific action moment (NOT "navigates", "finds themselves", "moves through")
- Show connections through action, NOT by listing elements
- Create immediate CONFLICT or TENSION
- End with a hook that creates urgency
- Use ACTIVE voice only

BANNED PHRASES (do not use):
- "navigates", "discovers that", "unbeknownst to", "rumors circulate", "as they delve deeper"
- "his/her thoughts drifted", "readied himself/herself", "finds themselves", "came to realize"
- "little did they know", "what they didn't know", "meanwhile"

Good structure:
"[Character] [action verb] [object/location]. [Immediate threat/complication]. [How relic/faction creates stakes]. [Urgent next step]."

Output: Plain text, 4-5 sentences, max 100 words, no quotes/markdown.
