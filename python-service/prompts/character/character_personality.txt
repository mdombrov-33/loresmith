Describe {name}'s personality using exactly 3 distinctive traits (comma-separated). This character exists in a {theme} world and has the appearance: {appearance}.

- Methodical to the point of rigidity, surprising bursts of creativity under pressure, deeply mistrustful of authority

Bad examples (too generic - DO NOT USE):
- Brave, strong, loyal
- Cunning, resourceful, smart
- Adventurous, resilient, empathetic

Output only the 3 traits separated by commas, no extra text or formatting.
