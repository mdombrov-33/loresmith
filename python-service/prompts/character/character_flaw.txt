Generate ONE distinctive character flaw or negative quirk for {name}, who has the personality: {personality} and backstory: {description}. This is a {theme} world.

This flaw should be:
- Specific and behavioral (not just "arrogant" but "interrupts people mid-sentence, assuming they know what others will say")
- A potential liability in dangerous or social situations
- Memorable and slightly unusual
- Related to their personality or backstory if possible
- Something that could create interesting complications in gameplay

Good examples:
- "Refuses to use pre-war technology, convinced it's cursed by the old world"
- "Compulsively hoards batteries and power cells, even completely drained ones"
- "Goes completely silent and unresponsive when stressed - just stares into space"
- "Trusts anyone who shares food, even obvious enemies or manipulators"
- "Cannot sleep indoors - panics in enclosed spaces after being buried alive"
- "Lies reflexively to anyone in authority, even when the truth would help"
- "Counts everything obsessively - bullets, steps, heartbeats - loses track of surroundings"

Bad examples (too vague):
- "Has trust issues"
- "Sometimes makes bad decisions"
- "Can be reckless"

Output: Plain text, one sentence describing the flaw, no explanation or extra formatting.
