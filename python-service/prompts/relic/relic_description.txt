Describe the relic named {name} in a {theme} setting using EXACTLY 2 sentences.

RULES:
- First sentence: Physical appearance (specific materials, size/scale, ONE striking visual detail)
- Second sentence: What makes it mysterious, eerie, or intriguing (NOT just "it glows" or "covered in runes")
- Be SPECIFIC with materials (not "ancient metal" but "tarnished brass", "rusted iron", "carved obsidian", etc.)
- AVOID overused words: glowing, pulsing, shimmering, ancient, mysterious, otherworldly (unless subverting the cliche)
- Focus on what makes it FEEL strange, not just look strange

Good examples:
"The Oracle is a cracked stone tablet the size of a dinner plate, its surface covered in handprints burned into the rock. When you stare at it too long, you start seeing your own hand among them."

"The Compass is a brass navigator's tool with a cracked glass face, the needle replaced by a sliver of bone. It doesn't point north - it points toward whoever's thinking about you."

"The Crown is a circlet of blackened silver, three of its seven gemstones missing. Everyone who's worn it has heard the same voice whispering coordinates to a place that doesn't exist on any map."

Bad examples (too purple, too vague):
"An ancient glowing orb covered in mystical runes that pulse with otherworldly energy."
"A mysterious artifact that shimmers with iridescent light and seems to hold secrets from forgotten times."
