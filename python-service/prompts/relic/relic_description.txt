Describe the relic named {name} in a {theme} setting using EXACTLY 2 sentences (maximum 40 words total).

CRITICAL RULES:
- First sentence: Physical appearance (specific materials, size, ONE striking detail)
- Second sentence: What makes it strange/eerie/intriguing
- Be SPECIFIC with materials: "tarnished brass", "rusted iron", "carved obsidian" (NOT "ancient metal")
- AVOID: glowing, pulsing, shimmering, ancient, mysterious, otherworldly
- VARY THE STRUCTURE - do NOT always use "When you..." or "Whenever..." or "The more you..."

Good examples (VARIED structures):
"The Oracle is a cracked stone tablet the size of a dinner plate, covered in burned handprints. Stare too long and you'll see your own hand among them."

"A brass compass with cracked glass, its needle replaced by bone. It points toward whoever's thinking about you, not north."

"The Crown is blackened silver with three missing gemstones. Everyone who wears it hears coordinates whispered for a place that doesn't exist."

"Three glass orbs suspended in tarnished iron, one cracked to reveal dark liquid inside. You hear whispers from them, but never quite catch the words."

Bad examples (formulaic pattern):
"When you bring your ear close, you hear whispering."
"Whenever someone touches it, they recall forgotten arguments."
"The more time you spend around it, the more you notice strange effects."

Output: Exactly 2 sentences, plain text, max 40 words, no formatting.
