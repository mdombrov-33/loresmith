Explain the lasting impact of {name} (described as: {description}) in EXACTLY 1 sentence (maximum 40 words) in a {theme} world.

RULES:
- Focus on ONE tangible, ongoing consequence - not vague societal change
- Be specific about WHO is affected and HOW
- Use concrete details, not abstractions
- AVOID: "changed society", "altered the course of history", "reshaped civilization"

Good examples (specific, concrete):
"Children born after the Shattering have moon-sicknessâ€”their bones grow brittle and they see visions of the sky falling."

"Every electronics engineer over 40 died in the EMP, so modern tech is now reverse-engineered by scavengers who don't understand the theory."

"The contaminated zone expands three feet south every year, and refugees flood into shrinking habitable territory."

Bad examples (too vague):
"The event fundamentally changed society and how people view the world, leaving lasting scars on civilization that persist to this day."

Output: Exactly 1 sentence, plain text, max 40 words, no formatting.
