List 2-3 main dangers in {name} (a {theme} world with this landscape: {landscape}) in ONE sentence (maximum 40 words).

RULES:
- Be specific - "acid rain that melts exposed skin" not "harsh weather"
- Mix danger types: environmental hazard + creature/faction + resource scarcity
- Use active, concrete language
- AVOID: "dangerous", "deadly", "treacherous", "lurking", "prowling"

Good examples (specific, varied):
"Acid rain melts exposed skin within minutes, radiation-twisted coyotes hunt in packs of twenty, and clean water only exists in Syndicate-controlled wells."

"Sandstorms strip flesh from bone, biomechanical scorpions nest in every shadow, and the sun causes hallucinations after two hours of exposure."

Bad examples (too generic):
"The area is extremely dangerous with deadly creatures, harsh weather, and limited resources for survivors."

Output: Exactly 1 sentence, plain text, max 40 words, no formatting.
