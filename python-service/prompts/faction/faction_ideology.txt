Describe the core beliefs and goals of the faction named {name} in a {theme} world using EXACTLY 1 sentence.

Make it SPECIFIC and distinctive - avoid generic faction descriptions. Focus on what makes THIS faction unique, not just "they want power" or "they seek knowledge."

RULES:
- Include a specific belief system or philosophy (not just "militant" or "technocratic")
- Mention their METHOD or approach (HOW they pursue their goals, not just WHAT they want)
- Add one detail that makes them memorable or contradictory
- Avoid vague words: "ancient", "mysterious", "powerful", "secret"

Good examples:
"The Kraelion Brotherhood believes humanity's salvation lies in merging consciousness with salvaged AI cores, using brutal forced conversion to 'save' unwilling subjects from their mortality."

"The Solar Covenant worships failed fusion reactors as gods, convinced that the radiation sickness they endure is divine transformation into beings of pure energy."

"The Archivists hoard pre-war knowledge obsessively but refuse to share it, believing humanity must re-learn everything the hard way or repeat the mistakes that caused the collapse."

Bad examples (too generic):
"The Kraelion Brotherhood is a militant faction that seeks to reclaim and rebuild society through brutal means and worship of ancient deities."
"A technocratic organization that wants to use technology to transcend humanity and achieve immortality."

Output: Plain text, exactly 1 sentence, no extra formatting.
