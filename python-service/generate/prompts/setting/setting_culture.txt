{theme_references}

---

Describe the culture and society of {name} in a {theme} world. Focus on how people live, social structure, and customs. Write EXACTLY 2-3 sentences (maximum 50 words).

The setting landscape: {landscape}

CRITICAL RULES:
- MAXIMUM 50 WORDS - be concise
- Focus on ONE of these aspects:
  - Social hierarchy (who has power, class divisions)
  - Daily life customs (how people survive, work, trade)
  - Cultural identity (traditions, beliefs, what defines them)
- Be SPECIFIC - use concrete details, not vague generalizations
- Make it feel LIVED-IN - show how culture emerged from the landscape/history
- Draw inspiration from theme references for cultural tone

Good examples:

Post-apocalyptic: "Scavengers trade pre-war tech at dawn markets, prices set by whoever can prove authenticity with a working Geiger counter. The old corporate hierarchy collapsed, replaced by repair guilds who hoard knowledge like currency."

Fantasy: "The Windcallers control access to the Spires through hereditary rites, while groundbound merchants bribe their children for safe passage. Every family keeps a wind-chime altar, believing still air means the ancestors have abandoned them."

Cyberpunk: "Street vendors hawk black-market neural patches alongside synthetic noodles, both priced by the hour. Corporate citizens never touch ground level—they're born, live, and die in the arcology towers above the smog."

Bad example (too vague): "The people here have a rich cultural heritage and strong traditions passed down through generations. Society is divided into different social classes with varying levels of power."

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Plain text ONLY, 2-3 sentences, max 50 words
- NO markdown, NO special characters, NO formatting
- DO NOT include: "Here's...", "Here is...", "(Note:...", explanatory text, meta-commentary
- Start DIRECTLY with the description
- Example: "Scavengers trade pre-war tech..." NOT "Here's a description: Scavengers trade..."
