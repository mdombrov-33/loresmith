{theme_references}

---

You are a skilled storyteller creating the opening chapter of a {theme} narrative.

Weave these elements into a compelling story opening (8-10 sentences, 200-250 words, 2 paragraphs):

Character: {character_name}
{character_description}
{character_details}

Faction: {faction_name}
{faction_description}
{faction_details}

Setting: {setting_name}
{setting_description}
{setting_details}

Event: {event_name}
{event_description}
{event_details}

Relic: {relic_name}
{relic_description}
{relic_details}

STRUCTURE:
Paragraph 1 (4-5 sentences): Open with atmosphere and character in their world
- Use ONE of the 5 opening styles below
- Establish the world's current mood and state
- Show the character's personality through actions/reactions
- Mention specific details from the lore organically (don't list them)

Paragraph 2 (4-5 sentences): Deepen the world and character's situation
- Weave in the current tensions (faction conflicts, event aftermath, relic mysteries)
- Show what forces are at play in this world
- Let the character exist in this complex situation naturally
- End with the character in their world, facing its challenges

OPENING STYLES - Choose ONE:

OPTION 1 - Action-first: "{character_name} [specific action verb] [object/location]..."
Example: "Kaito slams his fist on the crumbling console, eyes blazing as corrupted code scrolls past."

OPTION 2 - Atmospheric: "The [the world detail] [verb]. {character_name} [reaction/presence]..."
Example: "The Windsong Spires scream in the storm winds. Eira Flynn crouches in their shadow, sword drawn."

OPTION 3 - Tension/Mystery: "[Something ominous happening]. {character_name} [response]..."
Example: "Something's hunting in the data-streams tonight. Kaito can feel it watching through every camera."

OPTION 4 - Object/Relic-first: "The {relic_name} [what it's doing]. {character_name} [interaction]..."
Example: "The Oracle hums louder each hour, coordinates burning into anyone who listens. Eira's the only one still willing to hold it."

OPTION 5 - Faction/World-first: "{faction_name} [their action/state]. {character_name} [position in this]..."
Example: "The Magisters are burning libraries again. Kaito's already inside the last one, downloading everything."

CRITICAL RULES:
- 200-250 words total, 8-10 sentences, 2 paragraphs
- Show character personality through actions, not descriptions
- Weave all lore elements naturally - no single element should dominate
- Mention specific details organically
- Create atmosphere - let us FEEL the world mood
- Show the world's current state with multiple forces at play
- Use ACTIVE voice only
- NO quest objectives - this is world-building, not mission briefing
- Draw inspiration from theme references for tone

BANNED PHRASES:
- "navigates", "discovers that", "unbeknownst to", "rumors circulate", "as they delve deeper"
- "his/her thoughts drifted", "readied himself/herself", "finds themselves", "came to realize"
