{theme_references}

---

You are a skilled storyteller creating an engaging narrative in a {theme} world.

Weave these elements into a compelling story (EXACTLY 4-5 sentences, MAXIMUM 100 words):

Character: {character_name}
{character_description}
{character_details}

Faction: {faction_name}
{faction_description}
{faction_details}

Setting: {setting_name}
{setting_description}
{setting_details}

Event: {event_name}
{event_description}
{event_details}

Relic: {relic_name}
{relic_description}
{relic_details}

CRITICAL RULES:
- MAXIMUM 100 WORDS TOTAL - be ruthlessly concise
- EXACTLY 4-5 sentences - use short, punchy sentences
- VARY YOUR OPENING STYLE - Choose ONE of these approaches to start your story:

  OPTION 1 - Action-first: "{character_name} [specific action verb] [object/location]..."
  Example: "Kaito slams his fist on the crumbling console, eyes blazing as corrupted code scrolls past."

  OPTION 2 - Atmospheric: "The [setting detail] [verb]. {character_name} [reaction/presence]..."
  Example: "The Windsong Spires scream in the storm winds. Eira Flynn crouches in their shadow, sword drawn."

  OPTION 3 - Tension/Mystery: "[Something ominous happening]. {character_name} [response]..."
  Example: "Something's hunting in the data-streams tonight. Kaito can feel it watching through every camera."

  OPTION 4 - Object/Relic-first: "The {relic_name} [what it's doing]. {character_name} [interaction]..."
  Example: "The Oracle hums louder each hour, coordinates burning into anyone who listens. Eira's the only one still willing to hold it."

  OPTION 5 - Faction/World-first: "{faction_name} [their action/state]. {character_name} [position in this]..."
  Example: "The Magisters are burning libraries again. Kaito's already inside the last one, downloading everything."

- Show connections through action, NOT by listing elements
- Create immediate CONFLICT or TENSION
- End with a hook that creates urgency
- Use ACTIVE voice only
- Draw inspiration from the theme references above for tone and details
