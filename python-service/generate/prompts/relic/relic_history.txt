Explain the history and significance of the relic {name} in a {theme} world. The relic looks like this: {description}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Exactly 2 sentences, maximum 50 words total
- BE VAGUE about specific events - use phrases like "after the collapse", "in the old world", "when everything fell", "before the calamity"
- DO NOT invent specific event names (no "The Great Forgetting", "The Devourment", etc.)
- Focus on WHY the relic matters NOW, not detailed ancient history
- Make it mysterious and intriguing, not exhaustively explained

Good examples (vague, intriguing):
"The Compass surfaced after the collapse, passed between survivors who claim it guided them to safety. Some say it belonged to the last navigator before the world went dark."

"Nobody knows who made the Crown or why three gems are missing. What they do know: anyone who wears it hears coordinates to a place that shouldn't exist."

Bad examples (too specific, invents events):
"The Oracle was created during the Great Forgetting, a cataclysmic event that ravaged the world and caused widespread memory loss. It possesses the ability to erase the essence of existence from reality itself."

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Plain text ONLY, exactly 2 sentences, max 50 words
- NO markdown, NO special characters
- DO NOT include: "Here's...", "Here is...", explanatory text, meta-commentary
- Start DIRECTLY with the description
