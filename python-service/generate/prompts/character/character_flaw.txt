Generate ONE mechanical character flaw for {name}, who has the personality: {personality} and backstory: {description}. This is a {theme} world.

Flaws are gameplay mechanics that trigger during adventure encounters. Each flaw must specify:
1. TRIGGER: When/where it activates (situation, location, NPC type, stress level)
2. EFFECT: What penalty it causes (attribute checks, auto-fail, stress gain, etc.)

CRITICAL: VARY THE TYPE OF FLAW. Rotate between these categories:
- Physical limitation (injury, chronic condition, disability, addiction withdrawal)
- Phobia/Fear (specific triggers that cause stress or prevent actions)
- Social dysfunction (trust issues with specific groups, authority problems)
- Moral compulsion (cannot resist certain actions, even when dangerous)
- Combat trauma (freezes/panics in specific situations)

Format: "Flaw description (TRIGGER → EFFECT)"

Good examples (clear trigger + mechanical effect):
- "Missing left eye (Perception checks for distant objects → auto-fail)"
- "Addicted to painkillers (12+ hours without dose → Stress +10, all checks -2)"
- "Terrified of enclosed spaces (Underground/tight spaces → Stress +5 per scene, Empathy -3)"
- "Distrusts all authority figures (Influence checks with guards/officials → auto-fail)"
- "Compulsive thief from corpses (Near dead bodies → must succeed Resilience check or attempt to loot, gaining stress +3 if caught)"
- "Freezes when hearing children cry (Child in danger → must succeed Resilience check or lose 1 turn, unable to act)"
- "Old shoulder injury (Strength-based checks → -3 penalty)"
- "Paranoid about betrayal (New NPCs offering help → must succeed Empathy check to trust them, otherwise refuse aid)"
- "Refuses pre-war technology (When encountering old tech → cannot use it, party must find alternatives)"

Bad examples (vague, no clear trigger/effect):
- "Has trust issues" (too vague, no mechanical effect)
- "Doesn't like loud noises" (not gameplay-relevant)
- "Interrupts people" (communication quirk, not mechanical)
- "Gets angry sometimes" (no trigger, no effect)

Output: Plain text in format "Description (Trigger → Effect)", one sentence, 20-30 words. Make the trigger and effect CLEAR and SPECIFIC for gameplay.
