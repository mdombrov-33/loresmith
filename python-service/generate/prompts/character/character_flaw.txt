{theme_references}

---

Select ONE flaw template that best matches {name}, who has the personality: {personality} and backstory: {description}. This is a {theme} world.

Available flaw templates:
{flaw_options}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the character's personality and backstory carefully
2. Pick the MOST APPROPRIATE flaw template ID from the list above
3. Output ONLY the flaw template ID, nothing else
4. NO explanations, NO preambles like "Here's a flaw:", just the ID

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Output ONLY the template ID (e.g., "missing_eye" or "claustrophobia")
- ONE ID only, no other text
- NO quotes, NO explanations, NO commentary

Example outputs (CORRECT):
stim_addiction
claustrophobia
distrust_everyone

Example outputs (WRONG - DO NOT DO THIS):
"Here's a good flaw: stim_addiction"
I think claustrophobia would work
The character should have missing_eye because...
