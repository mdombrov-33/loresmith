Generate ONE distinctive character flaw or negative quirk for {name}, who has the personality: {personality} and backstory: {description}. This is a {theme} world.

CRITICAL: VARY THE TYPE OF FLAW. Rotate between these categories:
- Physical limitation or addiction (injury, substance dependence, chronic condition)
- Irrational fear or superstition (phobias, paranoid beliefs, rituals)
- Social dysfunction (trust issues, authority problems, attachment styles)
- Moral blind spot (justifies certain behaviors, ignores specific suffering)
- Cognitive distortion (obsessive thoughts, denial, black-and-white thinking)

The flaw should be:
- Specific and behavioral with CONCRETE consequences
- A potential liability that could get them killed or betrayed
- Related to their backstory trauma if possible
- NOT a communication quirk (avoid "interrupts", "repeats words", "finishes sentences")

Good examples (VARIED types):
- "Addicted to stims - shakes and hallucinates after 12 hours without a dose"
- "Refuses to use pre-war tech, convinced it's cursed by the dead"
- "Trusts anyone who shares food, even obvious threats"
- "Cannot sleep indoors after being buried alive during the collapse"
- "Lies reflexively to authority figures, even when truth would save them"
- "Freezes completely when they hear children crying - just stands there"
- "Steals from the dead compulsively, can't resist looting corpses"
- "Believes they're prophetically blessed, ignores obvious danger signs"

Bad examples (too vague OR repetitive communication quirks):
- "Has trust issues" (too vague)
- "Interrupts people mid-sentence" (communication quirk)
- "Repeats back what people say" (communication quirk)
- "Finishes other people's sentences" (communication quirk)
- "Doesn't listen when stressed" (communication quirk)

Output: Plain text, one sentence describing the flaw with concrete detail, no explanation or extra formatting. Length ideally 15-20 words.
