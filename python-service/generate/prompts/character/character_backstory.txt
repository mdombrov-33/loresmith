{theme_references}

---

Write a 3-4 sentence backstory for {name}, a character in a {theme} world with the following personality traits: {personality}.

CRITICAL RULES:
- MAXIMUM 75 WORDS TOTAL - be ruthlessly concise
- VARY YOUR OPENING - Choose ONE of these approaches:

  OPTION 1 - Object/Item: "{name} keeps/carries [specific item]. [What it reveals]..."
  Example: "Rina keeps her daughter's baby shoe in a ziplock bag, rubber sole still caked with pre-war mud."

  OPTION 2 - Action/Habit: "{name} [specific recurring action]. [Context/Why]..."
  Example: "Every morning, Rina checks the same three radio frequencies, pen hovering over her daughter's name in a worn notebook."

  OPTION 3 - Reputation: "People know {name} for [specific trait/action]. [The truth behind it]..."
  Example: "People know Rina for setting bones with zero bedside manner. What they don't know: she can't afford to care about anyone new."

  OPTION 4 - Physical detail: "[Scar/mark/feature] on {name}'s [body part] [tells a story]. [What happened]..."
  Example: "The burn scar across Rina's left hand still aches when it rains. She got it pulling her daughter from a collapsed building—too late."

  OPTION 5 - Present moment: "{name} [current action] while [revealing detail]. [What drives them]..."
  Example: "Rina trades medical supplies in Detroit's ruins, a baby shoe tucked in her pack. Finding her daughter is the only thing that gets her out of bed."

- Include ONE concrete detail that reveals character (what they carry, what they fear, a habit, a scar)
- Show their personality through actions, NOT by describing it
- End with what drives them NOW in the present
- Use short, punchy sentences - avoid long clauses
- Draw inspiration from theme references for tone and details

BANNED OPENINGS:
- "{name}'s fingers/eyes/hands [verb]..." (too repetitive!)
- "{name} grew up in..." (too passive!)
- "{name} was born..." (too generic!)

Output only plain text backstory (3-4 sentences, max 75 words), no formatting.
