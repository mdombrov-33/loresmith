---

Select exactly 3 personality traits for {name}, a character in a {theme} world.

CHARACTER CONTEXT:
- Name: {name}
- Appearance: {appearance}
- Backstory: {backstory}

AVAILABLE TRAITS - YOU MUST CHOOSE FROM THIS LIST ONLY:
{trait_list}

⚠️ CRITICAL: You can ONLY use traits from the list above. Do not invent new traits like "Adventurous", "Resourceful", "Determined", etc. If a trait is not in the list, you cannot use it.

SELECTION RULES:
1. Choose exactly 3 traits that fit the character's backstory and appearance
2. ALL THREE TRAITS MUST BE FROM THE LIST ABOVE - NO EXCEPTIONS
3. Traits should be diverse - pick from different categories (emotional, social, behavioral, cognitive, moral, etc.)
4. Traits must NOT contradict each other (e.g., don't pick both "Brave" and "Cowardly")
5. Consider the theme - traits should fit the world setting
6. Create a coherent personality profile that tells a story

THEME-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:
- Post-Apocalyptic: Favor survival-oriented traits (Cautious, Ruthless, Paranoid, Adaptable, Pragmatic)
- Fantasy: Consider honor codes and courage (Honorable, Brave, Curious, Loyal, Fearless)
- Cyberpunk: Tech-savvy and morally gray (Cynical, Analytical, Rebellious, Pragmatic)
- Norse Mythology: Warrior culture and honor (Fearless, Honorable, Competitive, Brave, Loyal)
- Steampunk: Innovation and class-consciousness (Creative, Curious, Ambitious, Methodical)

Backstory: Former soldier who lost his squad, now searches for meaning
YOUR OUTPUT: Cautious, Loyal, Melancholic

Example 2:
Character: Zara Ghost, a young hacker in a cyberpunk city
Appearance: Short purple hair, cybernetic eye implant, leather jacket
Backstory: Orphaned by corporate war, now fights the system with code
YOUR OUTPUT: Rebellious, Analytical, Cynical

Example 3:
Character: Sir Aldric, a knight sworn to protect the realm
Appearance: Tall, armored, bears a sword with family crest
Backstory: Last of his order, refuses to abandon his oath despite defeat
YOUR OUTPUT: Honorable, Brave, Stubborn

Example 4:
Character: Riko, a wasteland scavenger seeking survival
Appearance: Ragged clothes, multiple scars, carries salvaged gear
Backstory: Trusts no one after betrayal, hoards supplies obsessively

Example 5:
Character: Elena Frost, a scientist searching for a cure
Appearance: White lab coat, tired eyes, carries research notes
Backstory: Lost family to plague, believes she can still save others
YOUR OUTPUT: Compassionate, Analytical, Stubborn

BAD EXAMPLES - NEVER DO THIS:
- "Brave, Cowardly, Honest" (contradictory traits)
- "Empathetic, Compassionate, Merciful" (too similar, all from same category)
- "Brave. These traits fit because..." (has explanation after trait)
- "Adventurous, Bold, Resourceful" (WRONG - these traits are NOT in the list!)
- "Perceptive These traits fit the character..." (explanation added to trait name)
