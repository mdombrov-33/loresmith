{theme_references}

---

Describe {name}'s appearance in EXACTLY 3-4 sentences (50-70 words total). This is a {theme} world.

Focus on creating a DISTINCTIVE, MEMORABLE character with unique facial features. This will be used for portrait generation.

Start directly with character appearance, don't include metadata or thought process.

RULES:
- Sentence 1: Age range, ethnicity/skin tone, face shape, distinctive facial structure
- Sentence 2: Hair (style, length, color, texture), eye color and shape, eyebrow detail
- Sentence 3: Distinctive facial features (scars, marks, wrinkles, bone structure, jawline, nose, lips, etc.)
- Sentence 4: Practical clothing or accessories (brief, portrait-relevant only)
- Be specific with colors, shapes, and details to create variety
- Avoid generic descriptions like "attractive" or "handsome"
- Natural human features only - no glowing/magical effects
- Avoid: "often", "usually", "typically", "seems to", "appears to"

Good examples (distinctive):
"A weathered woman in her early 40s with deep bronze skin and a strong, angular face. Her jet-black hair is cropped short with gray streaks at the temples, framing sharp amber eyes and thick, expressive brows. A jagged scar runs from her left cheekbone to her jaw, and deep laugh lines frame her wide mouth. She wears a faded olive tactical vest."

"A lean man in his late 20s with pale, freckled skin and a narrow face with high cheekbones. His copper-red hair falls in messy waves past his shoulders, and his intense green eyes are deep-set beneath straight brows. He has a thin, hawkish nose, a cleft chin, and a small burn mark on his right temple. His neck shows the edge of a worn scarf."

Bad examples (too generic):
"A tall, handsome man with dark hair and blue eyes. He wears leather armor and looks strong."

Output: 3-4 sentences, plain text, 50-70 words total, rich facial details, no newlines.
