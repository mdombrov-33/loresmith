{theme_references}

---

Describe {name}'s appearance in EXACTLY 2 sentences (maximum 40 words total). This is a {theme} world.

Start directly with character appearance, don't include metadata or thought process.

RULES:
- First sentence: Height/build, hair, eye color, one facial feature
- Second sentence: Practical clothing + ONE memorable detail (scar, tattoo, distinctive item)
- Be concise - no flowery language or long clauses
- Avoid: "often", "usually", "typically", "seems to", "appears to"
- Natural human features only - no glowing/magical effects

Good examples (concise):
"Rina stands 5'8" with a lean build, short dark hair, and tired brown eyes. She wears a worn leather jacket over scavenged fatigues, a thin scar above her left eyebrow."

"Marcus is a stocky 6'2" with buzz-cut gray hair and sharp green eyes. He wears patched military gear and keeps a faded dog tag around his neck."

Bad examples (too wordy):
"Kael Jensen stands at about 5'9" with a lean yet athletic build, his dark brown hair often tied back in a practical ponytail to keep it out of his face as he navigates the harsh environment, and his bright blue eyes are framed by sharp cheekbones."

Output: Exactly 2 sentences, plain text, max 40 words total, no newlines.
